This is a personal project I developed using Node.js for the backend apis, postgreSQL for the database, and Express as the middleware. 
The frontend is developed entirely with React.js and CSS Grid for the flashcard application.

Users will be able to create an account or log in to an existing account where they will be presented with a list of courses to study. 
New users will have an empty course list and will have to add new courses before being able to add flashcards. Once a course is chosen, 
they will be able to add new flashcards to the course deck using the text boxes above the question list. Current users can edit question 
and answers of flashcards, edit course name, delete flashcards, or delete the course entirely. 

The flashcard application will randomly display, at most, 15 flashcards from the "deck" of cards created. Users are able to shuffle the 
deck and pull another 15 cards to test their knowledge of the subject. The flashcards are displayed in a grid-like layout and are interactive. 
Once an individual flashcard is pressed, it will flip 180 degrees (fully animated) to present the answer.


I first thought of this project back when my girlfriend was starting her nursing program. She had decks of flashcards that she hand-wrote for all her classes
that she would then use to study for any upcoming tests or quizes. I thought it would be much easier for her, or anyone with the same study habits, if all she needed 
was her laptop. After researching and studying the tech stack for a solid month I began construction of this web application.
